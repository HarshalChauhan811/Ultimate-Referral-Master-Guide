Referral ≠ Interview
Referral ≠ Guarantee

✔ Final decision is always taken by:
- Recruiter
- Hiring Manager

## 🚨 Important Truth — Referral is ALWAYS FREE

❌ Never pay money  
❌ Never give gifts  

🚫 If someone asks money for referral → **SCAM**

## 🆔 Job ID vs Application ID

### Job ID
- Job’s unique identification number
- Referral is done using **Job ID**
- Mandatory for referral

### Application ID
- Generated AFTER you apply
- Cannot be used for referral

📌 **Referral happens BEFORE applying**
